### 📚 Why I Made This

This is part of my journey to learn and apply:

- Object-oriented concepts (Inheritance, Encapsulation, Polymorphism)
- Flutter UI development
- Async/Await handling
- Server-client communication
- Real-time app behavior

### ⚙️ How to Run It Locally

1. Clone the repo:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mofakkharul-29/WhatsApp_Clone.git

   ```

2. Open my_clone/ in VS Code or Android Studio.
3. flutter pub get (Run Flutter pub get).
4. flutter run (Run Flutter pub get)
5. Open chat_server/ in another terminal and run the backend server.(currently in progress)

📝 Note
This is a practice project, not production-ready. I'm continuously improving it as I learn more. Feel free to explore or suggest improvements!
